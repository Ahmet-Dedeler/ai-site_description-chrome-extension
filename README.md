## What is it?

This Chrome extension tells you what a website is about before you visit it. It's like having a quick preview or a summary of the site's content.

## How does it work?

It uses AI to read the website's content and gives you a brief description. Here's how it's set up:

- Backend with FastAPI: This part talks to the AI service to get the website descriptions.
- Chrome Extension Frontend: This is what you interact with in your browser.

## Features

- Get quick summaries of websites with a click.
- Powered by AI for accurate descriptions.
- Simple and easy to use.

## How to start using it

1. Clone this repo to your computer.
2. Set up the backend by installing required packages (`pip install -r requirements.txt`) and starting the FastAPI server.
3. Load the extension in Chrome by going to `chrome://extensions/`, turning on Developer mode, and loading the `frontend` folder.
